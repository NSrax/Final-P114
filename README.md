basically a blog-like catalouging system for books, the user can view, add, edit and remove the entries.. 
in case the user deletes an entry, everything is ofcourse still stored in the database accessible from the admin page (user:admin pwd:admin).. 
thats about it, but satisfies all the requirements for this project.
