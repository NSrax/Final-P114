basically a blog-like catalouging system for books, the user can view, add, edit and remove the entries.. The users can also filter the books by author/category/book title.
In case the user deletes an entry, everything is ofcourse still stored in the database accessible from the admin page (user:admin pwd:admin).. 
thats about it, but satisfies all the requirements for this project.
